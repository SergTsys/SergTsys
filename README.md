# 👋 Hello! I'm Sergei

I’m a junior QA specialist, just getting started in the field of software testing.

I recently completed my training in software quality assurance and am continuing to grow professionally. Creating this GitHub profile is part of adopting tools and practices widely used in the IT industry — and GitHub has become one of my first steps.

## 🧰 What you'll find here

This profile is where I collect materials from my learning and practice — artifacts that stay after the work is done:

- ✅ Test cases  
- 📋 Checklists  
- 🐞 Bug reports  
- 📄 Test documentation  
- 💡 Notes from practice and training

These reflect my progress and help show my path in QA — one step at a time.
